# Social Media Platform
This is a social media platform developed using modern web technologies to provide a seamless and interactive user experience. This platform allows users to create and share posts, interact with each other's content, and express their moods through dynamic content display.

## Technologies Used 🛠️
- **React.js** (Frontend)
- **TanStack Query** (State Management)
- **Tailwind CSS** (Styling)
- **Daisy UI** (UI Components)
- **Node.js** (Backend)
- **Express.js** (Backend Framework)
- **MongoDB** (Database)
- **JWT** (Authentication)

This is a MERN stack project with a focus on creating a social media platform.

## Getting Started 🪂

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then create a `.env` file with the following environment variables:

```env
# Your local MongoDB URL
MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/social

# JWT Secret
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret

# Server Port
PORT=5000
```

Before running the app, ensure your local MongoDB server is running or skip this part if you're using an online database.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
